SNAP Distribution Schedule Database,,
,Overview,"There are 2 data tabs in this database: one for New York City (nyc), and one for all States, which includes the rest of New York (states). Note that there are 2 jurisdictions with business-day schedules (NYC and Pennsylvania). In NYC, distribution generally occurs over the first 10 business days of the month, with some weekend days and holidays excluded, and this has varied over time. In Pennsylvania, distribution occurs on the first 10 business days of month, excluding weekends and some holidays; this has varied over time and varies across counties (not all counties distribute over all 10 business days). We were unable to obtain the distribution schedule for these two jurisdictions for all periods. In some cases, we imputed the schedule, while in others, the schedule is missing in the data."
